Amazon Elastic Inference supports TensorFlow, Apache MXNet, PyTorch and ONNX models. Inference is the process of making predictions using a trained model. In deep learning applications, inference accounts for up to 90% of total operational costs for two reasons. Firstly, standalone GPU instances are typically designed for model training - not for inference. While training jobs batch process hundreds of data samples in parallel, inference jobs usually process a single input in real time, and thus consume a small amount of GPU compute. This makes standalone GPU inference cost-inefficient. On the other hand, standalone CPU instances are not specialized for matrix operations, and thus are often too slow for deep learning inference. Secondly, different models have different CPU, GPU, and memory requirements. Optimizing for one resource can lead to underutilization of other resources and higher costs."

Following data collection, you will quickly receive an assessment including a projected cost estimate and savings of running your on-premises workloads in the AWS Cloud. After receiving your initial assessment, your organization can work with the Migration Evaluator team to create a directional business case if additional insights are needed. The team will capture your migration objective and use analytics to narrow down the migration patterns best suited to your business needs. Your organization gets access to AWS expertise, visibility into the costs associated with multiple migration strategies, and insights on how reusing existing software licensing reduces costs further. Results are captured in a transparent business case report to further align business and technology stakeholders, while providing a prescriptive next step in your migration journey."

These rules are regularly updated as new issues emerge. AWS WAF includes a full-featured API that you can use to automate the creation, deployment, and maintenance of security rules. You can deploy AWS WAF on Amazon CloudFront as part of your CDN solution, the Application Load Balancer that fronts your web servers or origin servers running on EC2, Amazon API Gateway for your REST APIs, or AWS AppSync for your GraphQL APIs.\u00a0With AWS WAF, you pay only for what you use and the pricing is based on how many rules you deploy and how many web requests your application receives."

A broad range of workloads, such as relational and non-relational databases, enterprise applications, containerized applications, big data analytics engines, file systems, and media workflows are widely deployed on Amazon EBS.  You can choose from six different volume types to balance optimal price and performance. You can achieve single-digit-millisecond latency for high-performance database workloads such as SAP HANA or gigabyte per second throughput for large, sequential workloads such as Hadoop. You can change volume types, tune performance, or increase volume size without disrupting your critical applications, so you have cost-effective storage when you need it. Designed for mission-critical systems, EBS volumes are replicated within an Availability Zone (AZ) and can easily scale to petabytes of data. Also, you can use EBS Snapshots with automated lifecycle policies to back up your volumes in Amazon S3, while ensuring geographic protection of your data and business continuity."
